  ##### Video of Frankenbot rescuing six agents
  We know that the easiest way to describe the competition might be to show a video of our robot, Frankenbot, completing the challenge. Take a look! <br>

  ##### Description of the Competition
  The 2017 Mission Impossibots Competition is the 17th annual robotics design course and competition held by UBC Engineering Physics.  Sixteen teams of four students spent 6 weeks designing and building a fully autonomous robot that could complete the following tasks:
  <br> <br> -Navigate an 8 x 8 ft surface by following a path of black tape that leads to six 'captured' agents. 
  <br> <br> -Enter the 'lair' when the alarm door is not armed. The door is armed in conjunction with a change in an adjacent IR blaster’s frequency. (An IR signal of 1 kHz = unarmed and a 10 kHz signal = armed.) 
  <br> <br> - Pick up six agents (bath toys) from planks situated around a 22” diameter bowl filled with water. One minute after the competition commences, the agents drop into the bowl at five second intervals. 
  <br> <br>- Once retrieved, the agents must be sent down a zipline to safety.
